Variant Graph Craft (VGC) is an interactive genomic variant visualization program.

VGC is currently being packaged for depolyment. For now, we recommend the following steps:

1. Clone the VGC repository to your local computer. 
2. `cd` into the react-ui directory, and run the `command npm install`.
3. Run the VGCApplication.java file in your chosen IDE. This file can be found via `spring-boot -> src -> main -> java -> com -> example -> variantgraphcraftbackend -> VGCApplication.java`
4. In the react-ui directory, run the commmand `npm run electron-dev`.
